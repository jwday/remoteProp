# remoteProp
Sets up MQTT broker on a computer, an MQTT client on a browser, and an MQTT client on an ESP8266.
Using the web client you can control four valves attached to the ESP8266 either by press-and-hold or by pre-set time (currently only used for thrust testing).

Future work: Revise to allow 12x thruster control, faster data collection rate
